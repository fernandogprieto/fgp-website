## Test

I just took part in [Microservices March 2023](https://www.nginx.com/c/microservices-march-2023-agenda/), a free, month-long educational program designed to broaden
my understanding of microservices. I learned about the Twelve-Factor App, secrets management, automation,
and observability through webinars and hands-on labs. This experience has not only broadened my awareness
of microservices, but it has also provided me with useful insights and practical skills that I can implement
in my work.During the webinar, attendees can interact with other participants and the staff through chat,
asking questions and seeking clarifications. After the presentation, the staff opens the floor for a Q&A session.
Following the Q&A, they explain the labs, provide a 50-minute window to complete them, and offer assistance with any issues that may arise during the lab exercises.
